This is the first released version of Apache Scout, 
the Apache implementation of JAXR 1.0

Note that this version is not a complete implementation of
JAXR 1.0. We believe that it is complete except for support
of asynchronous requests.  This feature will be completed
soon for the Scout v1.0 release.
